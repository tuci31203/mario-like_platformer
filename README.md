# Nguyen Trung Chien - Project 1
## Super Mango Game

    This is my attempt to create a platformer game by utilizing Kaboom.js library that you can find at [**kaboom**](https://kaboomjs.com/)

    Most of the assets used can be find at [**JuhoSprite**](https://juhosprite.itch.io/super-mango-2d-pixelart-platformer-asset-pack16x16), and I also created additional items for level 4 by drawing in Photoshop.

## How to set up

    Download all the files then extract to a folder.
    Open the **mario-like platformer** in your IDE.
    You may have to adjust the url shortener depending on your folder structure.("./" <-> "../")
    Go live and play the game!

## Thank you for your time and interest!
