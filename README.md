## ✨ About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my first personal web project and I decided to create a game. Inspired by the classic Super Mario game and 2000s gameboy trend, I attempted to build a platformer that has similar navigation and added some personal features.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Basically, if you have VS Code installed, you should install `Liver server`extension and that's all needed


### Installing

+ Clone the project to your local directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/...
```

+ Open the project in VS Code and run live server, or run the project with a server

+ :warning: You may have to adjust the url shortener depending on your folder structure.("./" **&harr;** "../") if any error occurs.

> All required assets are included in this repository.
